<p><span class="smallcaps">The</span>   ma­na­­ger of the new Im­­pe­ri­al Re­­stau­rant on the Tha­­mes Em­­bank­­ment went
in­­to his lu­­xu­rious pri­va­te of­­fi­ce and shut the door. Ha­ving do­­ne so, he
first scrat­ched his chin re­flec­ti­ve­­ly, and then took a let­ter from the
dra­wer in which it had re­­po­­sed for mo­­re than two months and pe­ru­­sed it
care­­ful­­ly. Though he was not awa­­re of it, this was the thir­tieth time he
had read it sin­­ce break­fast that mor­­ning. And yet he was not a whit
ne­a­­rer un­­­der­­stan­­ding it than he had be­en at the be­­gin­­ning. He tur­­ned it
over and scru­ti­­ni­­zed the back, whe­­re not a sign of wri­ting was to be
seen; he held it up to the win­­dow, as if he might ho­­pe to dis­­co­­ver
so­­me­thing from the wa­ter­­-­­­mark; but the­­re was nothing in eit­her of the­­se
pla­­ces of a na­ture ca­l­­cu­la­ted to set his trou­b­led mind at rest. Then he
took a ma­g­ni­­fi­­cent re­­pea­ter watch from his waist­­coat po­cket and glan­­ced
at the di­a­l; the hands stood at ha­l­f­­-­­past se­­ven. He im­­me­­di­a­te­­ly threw
the let­ter on the ta­ble, and as he did so his an­­xie­­ty found re­­li­ef in
words.</p>  <p>"It­'s re­al­ly the most ex­tra­or­di­na­ry af­fair I ever had to do with," he
re­mar­ke­d. "And as I'­ve be­en in the busi­ness just three­-­an­d­-thir­ty years
at ele­ven a.m. next Mon­day mor­ning, I ought to know so­me­thing about it.
I on­ly ho­pe I'­ve do­ne right, that­'s all."</p>  <p>As he spo­ke, the chief book­kee­per, who had the treble ad­van­ta­ge of being
tall, pret­ty, and just eight­-­an­d­-t­wen­ty years of age, en­te­red the room.
She no­ti­ced the open let­ter and the look upon her chie­f­'s fa­ce, and her
cu­ri­o­si­ty was pro­por­ti­o­na­te­ly ex­ci­te­d.</p>  <p>"Y­ou seem wor­rie­d, Mr. Mc­Pher­son," she said ten­der­ly, as she put down
the pa­pers she had brought in for his si­gna­ture.</p>  <p>"Y­ou ha­ve just hit it, Miss O'­Sul­li­van," he ans­we­re­d, pu­shing them
far­ther on to the ta­ble. "I am wor­ried about ma­ny things, but
par­ti­cu­la­r­ly about this let­ter."</p>  <p>He han­ded the epist­le to her, and she, being de­si­rous of im­pres­sing him
with her busi­ness ca­pa­bi­li­ties, read it with os­ten­ta­tious care. But it
was no­ti­cea­ble that when she re­a­ched the si­gna­ture she too tur­ned back
to the be­gin­ning, and then de­li­be­ra­te­ly read it over again. The ma­na­ger
ro­se, cros­sed to the man­tel­pie­ce, and rang for the head wai­ter. Ha­ving
re­li­e­ved his fee­lings in this way, he sea­ted him­self again at his
wri­ting­-­ta­ble, put on his glas­ses, and sta­red at his com­pa­n­io­n, whi­le
wai­ting for her to speak.</p>  <p>"It­'s ve­ry fun­ny," she sai­d. "Ve­ry fun­ny in­de­e­d!"</p>  <p>"It­'s the most ex­tra­or­di­na­ry com­mu­ni­ca­ti­on I ha­ve ever re­cei­ve­d," he
re­p­lied with con­vic­ti­o­n. "Y­ou see it is writ­ten from Cu­ya­ba, Bra­zil. The
date is three months ago to a day. Now I ha­ve ta­ken the trou­ble to find
out whe­re and what Cu­ya­ba is."</p>  <p>He ma­de this con­fes­si­on with an air of con­s­cious pri­de, and ha­ving do­ne
so, laid him­self back in his chair, stuck his thumbs in­to the arm­ho­les
of his waist­coat, and loo­ked at his fair sub­or­di­na­te for ap­pro­va­l. Nor
was he des­ti­ned to be di­s­ap­poin­te­d. He was a ba­che­lor in pos­ses­si­on of a
snug in­co­me, and she, be­si­des being pret­ty, was a la­dy with a keen eye
to the main chan­ce.</p>  <p>"And whe­re  <em>is</em>  Cu­ya­ba?" she as­ked hum­b­ly.</p>  <p>"Cu­ya­ba," he re­p­lie­d, rol­ling his tongue with con­si­de­ra­ble re­lish round
his un­con­s­cious mispro­nun­cia­ti­on of the na­me, "is a town al­most on the
wes­tern or Bo­li­vi­an bor­der of Bra­zil. It is of mo­de­ra­te si­ze, is
si­tua­ted on the banks of the ri­ver Cu­ya­ba, and is con­si­dera­b­ly connec­ted
with the fa­mous Bra­zi­li­an Dia­mond Fields."</p>  <p>"And does the wri­ter of this let­ter live the­re?"</p>  <p>"I can­not say. He wri­tes from the­re­-­-­that is enough for us."</p>  <p>"And he or­ders din­ner for four­-­-­he­re, in a pri­va­te room over­loo­king the
ri­ve­r, three months ahea­d­-­-­punc­tu­al­ly at eight o'­clock, gi­ves you a list
of the things he want­s, and even ar­ran­ges the de­cora­ti­on of the ta­ble.
Says he has ne­ver seen eit­her of his three fri­ends be­fo­re; that one of
them hails from (he­re she con­sul­ted the let­ter again) Hang­-­chow, an­o­ther
from Bloem­fon­tein, whi­le the third re­si­des, at pre­sent, in Eng­lan­d. Each
one is to pre­sent an or­di­na­ry vi­si­t­ing card with a red dot on it to the
por­ter in the hall, and to be shown to the room at on­ce. I don­'t
un­der­stand it at all."</p>  <p>The ma­na­ger pau­sed for a mo­ment, and then said de­li­be­ra­te­ly,­-­-­"Hang­-­chow
is in China, Bloem­fon­tein is in South Af­ri­ca."</p>  <p>"What a won­der­ful man you are, to be su­re, Mr. Mc­Pher­son! I ne­ver can <em>think</em>  how you ma­na­ge to car­ry so much in your hea­d."</p>  <p>The­re spo­ke the true wo­man. And it was a mo­ve in the right di­rec­ti­o­n,
for the ma­na­ger was suscep­ti­ble to her gent­le in­flu­ence, as she had
oc­ca­si­on to know.</p>  <p>At this junc­ture the head wai­ter ap­pea­red upon the sce­ne, and took up a
po­si­ti­on just in­side the door­way, as if he we­re afraid of in­ju­ring the
ca­r­pet by co­ming far­ther.</p>  <p>"Is No. 22 rea­dy, Wil­li­ams?"</p>  <p>"Qui­te rea­dy, sir. The wi­ne is on the ice, and cook tells me he­'ll be
rea­dy to dish punc­tu­al to the mo­ment."</p>  <p>"The let­ter says, 'no elec­tric light; cand­les with red sha­des.' Ha­ve you
put on tho­se sha­des I got this mor­ning?"</p>  <p>"Just seen it do­ne this ve­ry mi­nu­te, sir."</p>  <p>"And let me see, the­re was one other thing." He took the let­ter from the
chief book­kee­per­'s hand and glan­ced at it. "Ah, yes, a por­ce­lain sau­cer,
and a small jug of new milk upon the man­tel­pie­ce. An ex­tra­or­di­na­ry
re­quest, but has it be­en at­ten­ded to?"</p>  <p>"I put it the­re my­sel­f, sir."</p>  <p>"Who wait?"</p>  <p>"Jo­nes, Ed­munds, Brooks, and Tom­kins."</p>  <p>"Ve­ry goo­d. Then I think that will do. Stay! You had bet­ter tell the
hall por­ter to look out for three gent­le­men pre­sen­ting plain vi­si­t­ing
cards with a litt­le red spot on them. Let Brooks wait in the hall, and
when they ar­rive tell him to show them straight up to the room."</p>  <p>"It shall be do­ne, sir."</p>  <p>The head wai­ter left the room, and the ma­na­ger stret­ched him­self in his
chair, yaw­ned by way of sho­wing his im­port­an­ce, and then said
so­lem­nly,­--</p>  <p>"I don­'t be­lie­ve they­'ll any of them turn up; but if they do, this Dr.
Ni­ko­la, whoe­ver he may be, won­'t be ab­le to find fault with my
ar­ran­ge­ment­s."</p>  <p>Then, lea­ving the dus­ty high road of Busi­ness, he and his com­pa­n­ion
wan­de­red in the sha­dy brid­le­-­paths of Love­-­-­to the end that when the
chief book­kee­per re­tur­ned to her own de­part­ment she had for­got­ten the
stran­ge din­ner par­ty about to take place ups­tair­s, and was bu­si­ly
en­ga­ged upon a cal­cu­la­ti­on as to how she would look in white sa­tin and
oran­ge blos­soms, an­d, that sett­le­d, fell to won­de­ring whe­ther it was
true, as Miss Joy­ce, a sub­or­di­na­te, had be­en heard to de­cla­re, that the
ma­na­ger had on­ce shown him­self par­ti­al to a cer­tain wi­dow with re­pu­ted
sa­vings and a share in an ex­ten­si­ve egg and dai­ry busi­ness.</p>  <p>At ten mi­nu­tes to eight pre­ci­se­ly a han­som drew up at the steps of the
ho­tel. As soon as it stop­pe­d, an un­der­si­zed gent­le­man, with a clean
sha­ven coun­te­nance, a ca­no­ni­cal cor­po­ra­ti­o­n, and bow legs, dres­sed in a
de­ci­ded­ly cle­ri­cal ga­r­b, aligh­te­d. He paid and dischar­ged his cab­man,
and then took from his ti­cket po­cket an or­di­na­ry white vi­si­t­ing card,
which he pre­sen­ted to the gold­-­la­ced in­di­vi­du­al who had ope­ned the
apron. The lat­ter, ha­ving no­ted the red spot, cal­led a wai­ter, and the
re­ve­rend gent­le­man was im­me­di­a­te­ly es­cor­ted ups­tair­s.</p>  <p>Hard­ly had the at­ten­dant time to re­turn to his sta­ti­on in the hall,
be­fo­re a se­cond cab ma­de its ap­pea­ran­ce, clo­se­ly fol­lo­wed by a third.
Out of the se­cond jum­ped a tall, ac­ti­ve, well­-­built man of about thir­ty
years of age. He was dres­sed in eve­ning dress of the la­test fa­shion, and
to con­ce­al it from the vul­gar ga­ze, wore a lar­ge In­ver­ness cape of hea­vy
tex­ture. He al­so in his turn han­ded a white card to the por­ter, an­d,
ha­ving do­ne so, pro­cee­ded in­to the hall, fol­lo­wed by the oc­cu­pant of the
last cab, who had clo­se­ly co­pied his ex­am­ple. This in­di­vi­du­al was al­so
in eve­ning dress, but it was of a dif­fe­rent stamp. It was old­-­fa­shio­ned
and had seen much use. The wea­re­r, too, was tal­ler than the or­di­na­ry run
of men, whi­le it was no­ti­cea­ble that his hair was snow­-­whi­te, and that
his face was de­e­p­ly pit­ted with small­pox. Af­ter dis­po­sing of their hats
and coats in an an­te­-­room, they re­a­ched room No. 22, whe­re they found
the gent­le­man in cle­ri­cal co­stu­me pa­cing im­pa­ti­ent­ly up and dow­n.</p>  <p>Left alo­ne, the tal­lest of the trio, who for want of a bet­ter tit­le we
may call the Best Dres­sed Man, took out his wat­ch, and ha­ving glan­ced at
it, loo­ked at his com­pa­n­ions. "Gent­le­men," he sai­d, with a slight
Ame­ri­can ac­cent, "it is three mi­nu­tes to eight o'­clock. My na­me is
Eas­to­ver­!"</p>  <p>"I­'m glad to he­ar it, for I'm most un­com­mon­ly hun­gry," said the next
tal­lest, whom I ha­ve al­rea­dy de­s­cri­bed as being so mar­ked by di­sea­se.
"My na­me is Pren­d­er­gast!"</p>  <p>"We on­ly wait for our fri­end and host," re­mar­ked the cle­ri­cal gent­le­man,
as if he felt he ought to take a share in the con­ver­sa­ti­o­n, and then, as
an af­tert­hought, he con­ti­nue­d, "My na­me is Bax­ter!"</p>  <p>They shook hands all round with mar­ked cor­di­a­li­ty, sea­ted them­sel­ves
again, and took it in turns to ex­ami­ne the clock.</p>  <p>"Ha­ve you ever had the ple­a­su­re of mee­ting our host be­fo­re?" as­ked Mr.
Bax­ter of Mr. Pren­d­er­gast.</p>  <p>"Ne­ver­," re­p­lied that gent­le­man, with a shake of his hea­d. "Per­haps Mr.
Eas­to­ver has be­en mo­re for­tu­na­te?"</p>  <p>"Not I," was the brief re­join­der. "I­'­ve had to do with him off and on
for lon­ger than I care to reckon, but I'­ve ne­ver set eyes on him up to
date."</p>  <p>"And whe­re may he ha­ve be­en the first time you heard from him?"</p>  <p>"In Nas­h­vil­le, Ten­nes­see," said Eas­to­ver. "Af­ter that, Ta­hu­pa­pa, New
Zea­lan­d; af­ter that, Pa­pee­te, in the So­ci­e­ty Is­lands; then Pe­kin, Chi­na.
And you?"</p>  <p>"First ti­me, Brus­sels; se­con­d, Mon­te Vi­deo; third, Man­da­lay, and then
the Gold Coast, Af­ri­ca. It­'s your turn, Mr. Bax­ter."</p>  <p>The cl­er­gy­man glan­ced at the ti­me­pie­ce. It was ex­act­ly eight o'­clock.
"First ti­me, Ca­bul, Af­gha­ni­stan; se­con­d, Ni­j­ni Nov­go­ro­d, Rus­sia; third,
Wil­can­nia, Dar­ling Ri­ve­r, Aus­tra­lia; four­th, Val­pa­rai­so, Chi­li; fift­h,
Na­gasa­ki, Ja­pan."</p>  <p>"He is evi­dent­ly a gre­at tra­vel­ler and a most mys­te­rious per­son."</p>  <p>"He is mo­re than that," said Eas­to­ver with con­vic­ti­o­n; "he is la­te for
din­ner!"</p>  <p>Pren­d­er­gast loo­ked at his watch.</p>  <p>"That clock is two mi­nu­tes fast. Hark, the­re goes Big Ben! Eight
ex­act­ly."</p>  <p>As he spo­ke the door was thrown open and a voi­ce an­noun­ced "Dr. Ni­ko­la."</p>  <p>The three men sprang to their feet si­mul­ta­neous­ly, with ex­cla­ma­ti­ons of
as­to­nis­h­ment, as the man they had be­en dis­cus­sing ma­de his ap­pea­ran­ce.</p>  <p>It would take mo­re time than I can spa­re the sub­ject to gi­ve you an
ade­qua­te and in­clu­si­ve de­s­crip­ti­on of the per­son who en­te­red the room at
that mo­ment. In sta­ture he was slight­ly abo­ve the or­di­na­ry, his
shoul­ders we­re broa­d, his limbs per­fect­ly sha­ped and plain­ly mus­cu­la­r,
but ve­ry slim. His hea­d, which was ma­gni­fi­cent­ly set upon his shoul­der­s,
was ad­or­ned with a pro­fu­si­on of glos­sy black hair; his face was
de­sti­tu­te of be­ard or mou­sta­che, and was of oval sha­pe and hand­so­me
moul­ding; whi­le his skin was of a dark oli­ve hue, a co­lour which
har­mo­ni­zed well with his pier­cing black eyes and pea­r­ly teeth. His hands
and feet we­re small, and the gre­a­test dan­dy must ha­ve ad­mit­ted that he
was ir­re­proacha­b­ly dres­se­d, with a neat­ness that bor­de­red on the
pu­ri­ta­ni­ca­l. In age he might ha­ve be­en any­thing from eight­-­an­d­-t­wen­ty to
for­ty; in re­a­li­ty he was thir­ty­-­three. He ad­van­ced in­to the room and
wal­ked with out­-­stret­ched hand di­rect­ly across to whe­re Eas­to­ver was
stan­ding by the fi­re­place.</p>  <p>"M­r. Eas­to­ver, I feel cer­tain," he sai­d, fi­xing his glit­te­ring eyes upon
the man he ad­dres­se­d, and al­lo­wi­ng a cu­rious smi­le to play upon his
face.</p>  <p>"That is my na­me, Dr. Ni­ko­la," the other ans­we­red with evi­dent sur­pri­se.
"But how on earth can you dis­tin­guish me from your other guest­s?"</p>  <p>"Ah! it would sur­pri­se you if you kne­w. And Mr. Pren­d­er­gast, and Mr.
Bax­ter. This is de­light­ful; I ho­pe I am not la­te. We had a col­li­si­on in
the Chan­nel this mor­ning, and I was al­most afraid I might not be up to
time. Din­ner seems rea­dy; shall we sit down to it?" They sea­ted
them­sel­ve­s, and the me­al com­mence­d. The Im­pe­ri­al Re­stau­rant has ear­ned
an en­via­ble re­pu­ta­ti­on for doing things well, and the din­ner that night
did not in any way de­tract from its lus­t­re. But, de­light­ful as it all
was, it was no­ti­cea­ble that the three guests paid mo­re at­ten­ti­on to
their host than to his ex­cel­lent  <em>me­nu</em>. As they had said be­fo­re his
ar­ri­va­l, they had all had de­alings with him for se­ver­al year­s, but what
tho­se de­alings we­re they we­re care­ful not to de­s­cri­be. It was mo­re than
pos­si­ble that they hard­ly li­ked to re­mem­ber them them­sel­ve­s.</p>  <p>When cof­fee had be­en ser­ved and the ser­vants had with­draw­n, Dr. Ni­ko­la
ro­se from the ta­ble, and went across to the mas­si­ve si­de­board. On it
stood a bas­ket of ve­ry cu­rious sha­pe and work­man­ship. This he ope­ne­d,
and as he did so, to the as­to­nis­h­ment of his guest­s, an enor­mous cat, as
black as his mas­ter­'s coat, lea­ped out on to the floor. The re­a­son for
the sau­cer and jug of milk be­ca­me evi­dent.</p>  <p>Sea­ting him­self at the ta­ble again, the host fol­lo­wed the ex­am­ple of his
guests and lit a ci­ga­r, blo­wi­ng a cloud of smo­ke lu­xu­rious­ly through his
de­li­ca­te­ly chi­sel­led no­strils. His eyes wan­de­red round the cor­ni­ce of
the room, took in the pic­tu­res and de­cora­ti­ons, and then ca­me down to
meet the faces of his com­pa­n­ions. As they did so, the black cat, ha­ving
fi­nis­hed its mea­l, sprang on to his shoul­der to crouch the­re, wat­ching
the three men through the cur­ling smo­ke drift with its green blin­king,
fi­en­dish eyes. Dr. Ni­ko­la smi­led as he no­ti­ced the ef­fect the ani­mal had
upon his guest­s.</p>  <p>"Now shall we get to busi­ness?" he said bris­kly.</p>  <p>The others al­most si­mul­ta­neous­ly kno­cked the as­hes off their ci­gars and
brought them­sel­ves to at­ten­ti­o­n. Dr. Ni­ko­la­'s dain­ty, lan­guid man­ner
see­med to drop from him li­ke a cloak, his eyes brigh­te­ne­d, and his
voi­ce, when he spo­ke, was clean cut as chi­sel­led sil­ver.</p>  <p>"Y­ou are doubt­less an­xious to be in­for­med why I sum­mo­ned you from all
parts of the glo­be to meet me here to­-­night? And it is ve­ry na­tu­ral you
should be. But then, from what you know of me, you should not be
sur­pri­sed at any­thing I do."</p>  <p>His voi­ce drop­ped back in­to its old to­ne of gent­le lan­guor. He drew in a
gre­at breath of smo­ke and then sent it slow­ly out from his lips again.
His eyes we­re ha­lf clo­se­d, and he drum­med with one fin­ger on the ta­ble
ed­ge. The cat loo­ked through the smo­ke at the three men, and it see­med
to them that he grew eve­ry mo­ment lar­ger and mo­re fero­cious. Pre­sent­ly
his ow­ner took him from his per­ch, and sea­ting him on his knee fell to
stro­king his fur, from head to tail, with his long slim fin­ger­s. It was
as if he we­re dra­wing in­spi­ra­ti­on for some dead­ly mi­s­chief from the
un­can­ny be­ast.</p>  <p>"To pre­face what I ha­ve to say to you, let me tell you that this is by
far the most im­port­ant busi­ness for which I ha­ve ever re­qui­red your
hel­p. (Three slow stro­kes down the cen­tre of the back, and one round
each ea­r.) When it first ca­me in­to my mind I was at a loss who to trust
in the mat­ter. I thought of Ven­don, but I found Ven­don was dea­d. I
thought of Brow­n­low, but Brow­n­low was no lon­ger faith­ful. (T­wo stro­kes
down the back and two on the thro­a­t.) Then bit by bit I re­mem­be­red you.
I was in Bra­zil at the time. So I sent for you. You ca­me. So far so
goo­d."</p>  <p>He ro­se, and cros­sed over to the fi­re­place. As he went the cat craw­led
back to its ori­gi­nal po­si­ti­on on his shoul­der. Then his voi­ce chan­ged
on­ce mo­re to its for­mer busi­ness­-­li­ke to­ne.</p>  <p>"I am not going to tell you ve­ry much about it. But from what I do tell
you, you will be ab­le to ga­ther a gre­at deal and ima­gi­ne the rest. To
be­gin with, the­re is a man li­ving in this world to­-­day who has do­ne me a
gre­at and las­ting in­ju­ry. What that in­ju­ry is is no con­cern of your­s.
You would not un­der­stand if I told you. So we­'ll lea­ve that out of the
ques­ti­o­n. He is im­men­se­ly rich. His cheque for £300,000 would be
ho­nou­red by his bank at any mi­nu­te. Ob­vious­ly he is a pow­er. He has had
re­a­son to know that I am pit­ting my wits against his, and he flat­ters
him­self that so far he has got the bet­ter of me. That is be­cau­se I am
dra­wing him on. I am ma­tu­ring a plan which will ma­ke him a poor and a
ve­ry mi­se­ra­ble man at one and the sa­me time. If that sche­me suc­ceeds,
and I am sa­tis­fied with the way you three men ha­ve per­for­med the parts I
shall call on you to play in it, I shall pay to each of you the sum of
£10,000. If it does­n­'t suc­cee­d, then you will each re­cei­ve a thou­sand
and your ex­pen­ses. Do you fol­low me?"</p>  <p>It was evi­dent from their faces that they hung upon his eve­ry word.</p>  <p>"But, re­mem­ber, I de­mand from you your who­le and en­ti­re la­bour. Whi­le
you are ser­ving me you are mi­ne bo­dy and soul. I know you are
trust­wor­thy. I ha­ve had good proof that you are­-­-­par­don the
ex­pres­sion­-­-­un­s­cru­pu­lous, and I flat­ter my­self you are si­lent. What is
mo­re, I shall tell you nothing beyond what is ne­ces­sa­ry for the car­ry­ing
out of my sche­me, so that you could not be­tray me if you would. Now for
my plans!"</p>  <p>He sat down again and took a pa­per from his po­cket. Ha­ving pe­ru­sed it,
he tur­ned to Eas­to­ver.</p>  <p>"Y­ou will lea­ve at on­ce­-­-­that is to say, by the boat on Wed­nes­day­-­-­for
Syd­ney. You will book your pas­sa­ge to­-­mor­row mor­ning, first thing, and
join her in Ply­mouth. You will meet me to­-­mor­row eve­ning at an ad­dress I
will send you, and re­cei­ve your fi­nal in­struc­ti­ons. Goo­d­-­night."</p>  <p>Seeing that he was ex­pec­ted to go, Eas­to­ver ro­se, shook hands, and left
the room wi­thout a word. He was too as­to­nis­hed to he­si­ta­te or to say
any­thing.</p>  <p>Ni­ko­la took an­o­ther let­ter from his po­cket and tur­ned to Pren­d­er­gast.
"<em>You</em>  will go down to Do­ver to­-­night, cross to Pa­ris to­-­mor­row mor­ning,
and lea­ve this let­ter per­so­nal­ly at the ad­dress you will find writ­ten on
it. On Thurs­day, at ha­l­f­-­past two pre­ci­se­ly, you will de­li­ver me an
ans­wer in the porch at Cha­ring Cross. You will find suf­fi­cient mo­ney in
that en­ve­lo­pe to pay all your ex­pen­ses. Now go!"</p>  <p>"At ha­l­f­-­past two you shall ha­ve your ans­wer. Goo­d­-­night."</p>  <p>"Goo­d­-­night."</p>  <p>When Pren­d­er­gast had left the room, Dr. Ni­ko­la lit an­o­ther ci­gar and
tur­ned his at­ten­ti­ons to Mr. Bax­ter.</p>  <p>"Six months ago, Mr. Bax­ter, I found for you a si­tua­ti­on as tu­tor to the
young Ma­r­quis of Be­cken­ham. You still hold it, I sup­po­se?"</p>  <p>"I do."</p>  <p>"Is the fa­ther well dis­po­sed to­wards you?"</p>  <p>"In eve­ry way. I ha­ve do­ne my best to in­gra­tia­te my­self with him. That
was one of your in­struc­ti­ons­."</p>  <p>"Yes, yes! But I was not cer­tain that you would suc­cee­d. If the old man
is any­thing li­ke what he was when I last met him he must still be a
dif­fi­cult per­son to deal with. Does the boy li­ke you?"</p>  <p>"I ho­pe so."</p>  <p>"Ha­ve you brought me his pho­to­graph as I di­rec­te­d?"</p>  <p>"I ha­ve. Here it is."</p>  <p>Bax­ter took a pho­to­graph from his po­cket and han­ded it across the ta­ble.</p>  <p>"Goo­d. You ha­ve do­ne ve­ry well, Mr. Bax­ter. I am ple­a­sed with you.
To­-­mor­row mor­ning you will go back to York­s­hi­re­-­-­-­-"</p>  <p>"I beg your par­don, Bour­ne­mouth. His Grace owns a hou­se ne­ar
Bour­ne­mouth, which he oc­cu­pies du­ring the sum­mer months."</p>  <p>"Ve­ry well­-­-­then to­-­mor­row mor­ning you will go back to Bour­ne­mouth and
con­ti­nue to in­gra­tia­te your­self with fa­ther and son. You will al­so be­gin
to im­plant in the boy­'s mind a de­sire for tra­vel. Don­'t let him be­co­me
awa­re that his de­sire has its sour­ce in you­-­-­but do not fail to fos­ter
it all you can. I will com­mu­ni­ca­te with you fur­ther in a day or two. Now
go."</p>  <p>Bax­ter in his turn left the room. The door clo­se­d. Dr. Ni­ko­la pi­cked up
the pho­to­graph and stu­died it.</p>  <p>"The li­ken­ess is un­mi­sta­ka­ble­-­-­or it ought to be. My fri­en­d, my ve­ry
de­ar fri­en­d, Wethe­rell, my toils are clo­sing on you. My ar­ran­ge­ments are
per­fec­ting them­sel­ves ad­mi­ra­b­ly. Pre­sent­ly, when all is com­ple­te, I
shall press the le­ver, the ma­chi­ne­ry will be set in mo­ti­o­n, and you will
find your­self being slow­ly but su­re­ly ground in­to pow­der. Then you will
hand over what I want, and be sor­ry you thought fit to baulk Dr.
Ni­ko­la!"</p>  <p>He rang the bell and or­de­red his bill. This du­ty dischar­ge­d, he pla­ced
the cat back in its pri­son, shut the li­d, de­scen­ded with the bas­ket to
the hall, and cal­led a han­som. The por­ter in­qui­red to what ad­dress he
should or­der the cab­man to drive. Dr. Ni­ko­la did not re­p­ly for a mo­ment,
then he sai­d, as if he had be­en thin­king so­me­thing out: "The  <em>Green
Sai­lor</em>  pu­blic­-­hou­se, East In­dia Dock Roa­d."</p>  <hr class="docutils">
