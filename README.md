About Malaclypse Blog 
=====

Philosophical aspect 
----
This project ist heavily inspired by [the "Illuminatus!" trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illuminatus!_Trilogy) from Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea. Through Personifying another Incarnation of Malaclypse it is my goal to provide a entertaining discordian view on the blogs subjects. 

Of course the website will not collect any personal data as it is stated ironicly in the "Impressum" neither will anything be transmitted to intelligence agencies. There are already enough websites collecting our personal information and I'm sure the agencies gather their own copy of unencrypted messages traversing their network. I feel somewhat urged to mention this just for the case there are some people without some sense for irony.


Technical aspect 
----
Besides the linguistic content the project's webspace will also serve me as some playground to implement some ideas  and embed it in the blog's context. Though in the case I implement something worth mentionning the technical aspect will be explained here on github while fullfilling the magical part in the content of the blog. 


German language
----
For the moment the blog will be realesed in german only and there are no plans for a translation. It is my goal to provide on a somewhat regular base new content and for this reason it would bother me too much, to always struggling for a nuanced formulation in a foreign language. However if there is a native speaker with the right attitude who has the capability of translating german text into english, I could imagine to continue this project in both languages and translating the english part to german.
